For a simple HTML page displaying "Hello World", we don't need a complex architecture or multiple files with classes and methods. HTML is not a programming language with classes and methods, but a markup language. Therefore, the task can be accomplished with a single HTML file.

Here's the content of the HTML file:

index.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a fully functional HTML file that, when opened in a web browser, will display a page with "Hello World" as a heading. There are no other dependencies or additional files required for this task.

this concludes a fully working implementation.
