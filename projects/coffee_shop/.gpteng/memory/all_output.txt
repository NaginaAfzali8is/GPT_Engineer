To create a simple coffee shop application in Python, we will need several core classes and functions to handle the different aspects of the coffee shop's operations. Here's an outline of the core components:

- `Product`: A class to represent a product (e.g., coffee, tea, pastry) sold at the coffee shop.
- `Inventory`: A class to manage the inventory of products.
- `Order`: A class to represent a customer's order.
- `OrderItem`: A class to represent an item within an order.
- `Menu`: A class to represent the menu of available products.
- `CashRegister`: A class to handle transactions and payment.
- `CoffeeShop`: A class to encapsulate the overall functionality of the coffee shop.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application that will create an instance of the coffee shop and handle user interactions.

Let's start by creating the entry point file and then proceed to the classes that are imported by that file.

main.py
```python
from coffee_shop import CoffeeShop

def main():
    # Initialize the coffee shop application
    coffee_shop = CoffeeShop()
    # Start the coffee shop operations
    coffee_shop.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

coffee_shop.py
```python
from menu import Menu
from inventory import Inventory
from cash_register import CashRegister

class CoffeeShop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.menu = Menu()
        self.inventory = Inventory()
        self.cash_register = CashRegister()

    def start(self):
        # This method would contain the logic to start the coffee shop operations
        # For simplicity, we'll just print a welcome message
        print("Welcome to the Coffee Shop!")
        # Here you would add more functionality such as taking orders, processing payments, etc.
```

menu.py
```python
from product import Product

class Menu:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self.load_menu()

    def load_menu(self):
        # This method would load the menu items from a database or file
        # For simplicity, we'll create some dummy products
        self.items.append(Product("Coffee", 2.5))
        self.items.append(Product("Tea", 2.0))
        self.items.append(Product("Croissant", 3.0))

    def display_menu(self):
        # This method would display the menu to the customer
        for item in self.items:
            print(f"{item.name}: ${item.price}")
```

product.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Product:
    name: str
    price: float
```

inventory.py
```python
from product import Product

class Inventory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stock = {}
        self.load_inventory()

    def load_inventory(self):
        # This method would load the inventory from a database or file
        # For simplicity, we'll create some dummy stock levels
        self.stock[Product("Coffee", 2.5)] = 10
        self.stock[Product("Tea", 2.0)] = 20
        self.stock[Product("Croissant", 3.0)] = 15

    def check_stock(self, product, quantity):
        # This method checks if the requested quantity of a product is available
        return self.stock.get(product, 0) >= quantity

    def reduce_stock(self, product, quantity):
        # This method reduces the stock level of a product
        if self.check_stock(product, quantity):
            self.stock[product] -= quantity
```

cash_register.py
```python
class CashRegister:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_sales = 0.0

    def process_payment(self, amount):
        # This method processes the payment for an order
        self.total_sales += amount
        print(f"Payment of ${amount} processed. Total sales: ${self.total_sales}")
```

order.py
```python
from order_item import OrderItem

class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, order_item):
        # This method adds an item to the order
        self.items.append(order_item)

    def calculate_total(self):
        # This method calculates the total price of the order
        return sum(item.product.price * item.quantity for item in self.items)
```

order_item.py
```python
from product import Product

class OrderItem:
    def __init__(self, product, quantity):
        self.product = product
        self.quantity = quantity
```

requirements.txt
```
# This file should list all Python dependencies for the coffee shop application
# Since we are using only built-in libraries, this file is currently empty
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
