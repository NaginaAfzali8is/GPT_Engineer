To create a fully working implementation, we need to define the goal of the project. Since the initial request mentioned "tracker location", I will assume we are building a simple location tracking system. This system will consist of a tracker device that sends its location to a server, which can then be queried to retrieve the last known location of the tracker.

Here's an outline of the core components we'll need:

1. `Tracker` class: Represents a tracking device, capable of sending its location.
2. `Location` class: Represents a geographical location with latitude and longitude.
3. `TrackerServer` class: Accepts location updates from trackers and stores the latest location.
4. `LocationStorage` class: Manages the storage of location data.
5. `main` function: The entry point of the application, setting up the server and possibly simulating tracker updates.

Let's start with the entrypoint file:

main.py
```python
from tracker_server import TrackerServer
from tracker import Tracker

def main():
    # Initialize the server
    server = TrackerServer()

    # Simulate a tracker sending its location
    tracker = Tracker('tracker_001', server)
    tracker.send_location(52.5200, 13.4050)  # Example coordinates for Berlin, Germany

    # Retrieve and print the location from the server
    location = server.get_location('tracker_001')
    print(f"Tracker 'tracker_001' is located at {location.latitude}, {location.longitude}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's define the `Tracker` class:

tracker.py
```python
from location import Location

class Tracker:
    def __init__(self, identifier, server):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.server = server

    def send_location(self, latitude, longitude):
        location = Location(latitude, longitude)
        self.server.update_location(self.identifier, location)
```

Next, we'll define the `Location` class:

location.py
```python
class Location:
    def __init__(self, latitude, longitude):
        self.latitude = latitude
        self.longitude = longitude
```

Now, let's implement the `TrackerServer` class:

tracker_server.py
```python
from location_storage import LocationStorage

class TrackerServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = LocationStorage()

    def update_location(self, tracker_id, location):
        self.storage.store_location(tracker_id, location)

    def get_location(self, tracker_id):
        return self.storage.retrieve_location(tracker_id)
```

We also need to implement the `LocationStorage` class:

location_storage.py
```python
class LocationStorage:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locations = {}

    def store_location(self, tracker_id, location):
        self.locations[tracker_id] = location

    def retrieve_location(self, tracker_id):
        return self.locations.get(tracker_id)
```

Lastly, we need a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies:

requirements.txt
```
# This file is intentionally left empty as the current implementation does not require external dependencies.
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
