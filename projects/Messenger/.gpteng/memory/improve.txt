To address the request, we need to create a new `index.html` file within the `frontend` directory. This file will serve as the entry point for the frontend application. It should include the basic HTML5 structure and a reference to the bundled JavaScript file that will be generated by the build process (usually `src/index.js`).

Here's a step-by-step description of the changes that will be made:

1. Create a new file named `index.html` in the `frontend` directory.
2. Add the basic HTML5 document structure to the `index.html` file.
3. Include a `<div>` element with an id of "root" where our React application will be mounted.
4. Add a `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag to link the JavaScript bundle. The `src` attribute of the script tag will point to the bundled JavaScript file, which is typically named `bundle.js` or `main.js` depending on the build tool configuration.

Now, let's write the changes in the unified "git diff" syntax:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ frontend/index.html
@@ -0,0 +1,14 @@

+<html lang="en">

+<body>
+    <div id="root"></div>
+    <!-- The bundled JavaScript file will be linked here -->
+    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
+</body>
+</html>
```

These changes yield a fully functional program according to the instructions.
