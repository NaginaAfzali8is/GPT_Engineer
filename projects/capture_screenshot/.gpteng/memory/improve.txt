To fulfill the request, we need to implement several functionalities across different files:

1. In `main.py`, we will create the main entry point of the application that will use the `ScreenshotTaker` and `Scheduler` classes to take screenshots and possibly schedule this action.

2. In `screenshot_taker.py`, we will define the `ScreenshotTaker` class with methods to capture a screenshot and retrieve the active URL from the browser.

3. In `scheduler.py`, we will define the `Scheduler` class that can be used to schedule the screenshot taking action at regular intervals.

4. In `requirements.txt`, we will list all the necessary Python packages that need to be installed for this project to work, such as `pyautogui` for taking screenshots, `pygetwindow` to get the active window title, and possibly a browser automation tool like `selenium` to get the active URL from the browser.

Let's start with the changes:

PLANNING:
- In `main.py`, create a main function that initializes `ScreenshotTaker` and `Scheduler` and starts the screenshot taking process.
- In `screenshot_taker.py`, define the `ScreenshotTaker` class with methods `take_screenshot` and `get_active_url`.
- In `scheduler.py`, define the `Scheduler` class with a method `schedule` that takes a function and an interval as arguments and runs the function at the given interval.
- In `requirements.txt`, list the necessary packages.

OUTPUT:

```python
main.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Main entry point for the screenshot and URL retrieval application

from screenshot_taker import ScreenshotTaker
from scheduler import Scheduler

def main():
    screenshot_taker = ScreenshotTaker()
    scheduler = Scheduler()

    # Example of scheduling a screenshot every 60 seconds
    scheduler.schedule(screenshot_taker.take_screenshot_and_get_url, 60)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
screenshot_taker.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# ScreenshotTaker class to capture screenshots and get the active URL

import pyautogui
import pygetwindow as gw
from selenium import webdriver

class ScreenshotTaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Chrome()  # Initialize the browser driver

    def take_screenshot(self):
        screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
        screenshot.save('screenshot.png')  # Save the screenshot

    def get_active_url(self):
        title = gw.getActiveWindowTitle()
        if " - Google Chrome" in title:
            self.browser.switch_to.window(title)
            return self.browser.current_url
        return None

    def take_screenshot_and_get_url(self):
        self.take_screenshot()
        return self.get_active_url()
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
scheduler.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Scheduler class to schedule tasks at regular intervals

import time
import threading

class Scheduler:
    def schedule(self, action, interval):
        def scheduled_action():
            while True:
                action()
                time.sleep(interval)

        thread = threading.Thread(target=scheduled_action)
        thread.start()
>>>>>>> updated
```

```plaintext

```

Please note that the `screenshot_taker.py` assumes the use of Google Chrome as the browser, and the `get_active_url` method is tailored to work with it. If a different browser is used, the method will need to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the `Scheduler` class provided is a simple implementation and may not handle edge cases or errors that could occur in a production environment.
