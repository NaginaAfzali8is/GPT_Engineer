```sh
# Since there are no dependencies required, we can directly run the codebase.
# To run the server part of the codebase
python main.py server 8080 &

# To run the client part of the codebase (assuming we want to send a file named "example.txt" to localhost on port 8080)
python main.py client localhost 8080 example.txt
```
