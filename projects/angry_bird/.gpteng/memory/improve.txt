To make the game attractive, we need to add some essential components such as a main game loop, rendering logic, game objects, and interactions between them. Since there is no existing code provided, I will outline the necessary changes and create the basic structure for a simple game that could be expanded upon.

PLANNING:
1. Create a `Game` class in `game.py` that will handle the main game loop, including initialization, updating, and rendering.
2. Implement a `GameEngine` class in `game_engine.py` that will manage the game state and interactions between game objects.
3. Define a `Level` class in `level.py` that will hold the layout and logic for different levels in the game.
4. Create a `Vector2D` class in `vector2d.py` to handle 2D vector operations which are useful for physics and movement calculations.
5. Develop a `GameObject` class in `game_object.py` as a base class for all objects in the game that can interact with each other.
6. Add a `Bird` class in `bird.py` that inherits from `GameObject` and represents the player's character.
7. Implement a `Pig` class in `pig.py` that also inherits from `GameObject` and represents the enemies in the game.
8. Create a `Block` class in `block.py` that will be used to construct obstacles and structures within the game levels.

            self.update()
            self.render()

    def update(self):
        self.engine.update()

        self.objects = []

    def load(self, level_data):
        # Load level layout from data
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Update level state

class Vector2D:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Add more vector operations as needed
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
game_object.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Base class for all game objects
class GameObject:
    def __init__(self, position, sprite):
        self.position = position
        self.sprite = sprite

    def update(self):
        # Update object state
        pass

    def render(self):
        # Render object sprite
        pass
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
bird.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Bird class representing the player's character
class Bird(GameObject):
    def __init__(self, position):
        super().__init__(position, sprite='bird_sprite.png')

    def launch(self, direction, force):
        # Logic for launching the bird
        pass
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Pig class representing the enemies in the game
class Pig(GameObject):
    def __init__(self, position):
        super().__init__(position, sprite='pig_sprite.png')

    def update(self):
        # Additional pig-specific logic
        pass
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
block.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
# Block class for constructing obstacles and structures
class Block(GameObject):
    def __init__(self, position, material):
        super().__init__(position, sprite=f'{material}_block_sprite.png')

    # Additional block-specific logic can be added here
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes provide a foundational structure for a game. Further development would include implementing rendering with a graphics library, adding physics for movement and collisions, and creating more detailed game logic and level designs.
