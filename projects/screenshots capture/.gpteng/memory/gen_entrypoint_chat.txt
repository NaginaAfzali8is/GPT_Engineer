pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Since the codebase is a Chrome extension, there is no traditional "run" command.
# Instead, you would load the extension into a Chrome browser for testing.
# However, you can run tests if they are defined.

# To run tests (assuming they are set up to be invoked with pytest)
pytest
