To create a train booking system, we will need several core components. Here's a list of the core classes and functions, along with a brief comment on their purpose:

- `Train`: Represents a train with a unique identifier, capacity, and schedule.
- `Seat`: Represents a seat within a train, with a seat number and booking status.
- `Schedule`: Represents the train's schedule, with departure and arrival times and stations.
- `Station`: Represents a train station with a name and location.
- `Booking`: Represents a booking, with a reference to a train, seat, and passenger details.
- `BookingManager`: Manages bookings, including creating, updating, and canceling bookings.
- `TrainManager`: Manages train details, including schedules and seat availability.
- `StationManager`: Manages station details.
- `UserInterface`: Provides an interface for users to interact with the booking system.

We will start with the entry point file and then proceed to the other files that are imported by that file.

entrypoint.py
```
from user_interface import UserInterface

def main():
    ui = UserInterface()
    ui.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

user_interface.py
```
from booking_manager import BookingManager
from train_manager import TrainManager
from station_manager import StationManager

class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.booking_manager = BookingManager()
        self.train_manager = TrainManager()
        self.station_manager = StationManager()

    def run(self):
        # This method would contain the logic to interact with the user
        # For simplicity, we will just print a welcome message
        print("Welcome to the Train Booking System")

# More methods would be added here to handle user input and interact with the system
```

booking_manager.py
```
from booking import Booking

class BookingManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bookings = []

    def create_booking(self, train, seat, passenger):
        booking = Booking(train, seat, passenger)
        self.bookings.append(booking)
        return booking

    def cancel_booking(self, booking_id):
        # Logic to cancel a booking
        pass

    def update_booking(self, booking_id, new_details):
        # Logic to update a booking
        pass

# More methods could be added here for managing bookings
```

booking.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Booking:
    train: 'Train'
    seat: 'Seat'
    passenger: 'Passenger'

# Additional attributes and methods could be added here for booking details
```

train_manager.py

from train import Train

class TrainManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trains = []

    def add_train(self, train):
        self.trains.append(train)

    def remove_train(self, train_id):
        # Logic to remove a train
        pass

    def find_train(self, train_id):
        # Logic to find a train
        pass

# More methods could be added here for managing trains
```

train.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass
from schedule import Schedule
from seat import Seat

@dataclass
class Train:
    id: str
    capacity: int
    schedule: Schedule
    seats: list[Seat]

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.seats = [Seat(seat_number=i) for i in range(1, self.capacity + 1)]

# Additional attributes and methods could be added here for train details
```

seat.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Seat:
    seat_number: int
    is_booked: bool = False

# Additional attributes and methods could be added here for seat details
```

schedule.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class Schedule:
    departure_station: 'Station'
    arrival_station: 'Station'
    departure_time: datetime
    arrival_time: datetime

# Additional attributes and methods could be added here for schedule details
```

station_manager.py
```
from station import Station

class StationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stations = []

    def add_station(self, station):
        self.stations.append(station)

    def remove_station(self, station_name):
        # Logic to remove a station
        pass

    def find_station(self, station_name):
        # Logic to find a station
        pass

# More methods could be added here for managing stations
```

station.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Station:
    name: str
    location: str

# Additional attributes and methods could be added here for station details
```

requirements.txt
```
# This file should list all Python dependencies required for the train booking system
```

This concludes the core structure of the train booking system. Each class and function would need to be fleshed out with more detailed logic and error handling. The `UserInterface` class would need methods to handle user input and display output, and the `requirements.txt` file would need to list any third-party libraries used. However, this provides a solid foundation for a fully working implementation.
