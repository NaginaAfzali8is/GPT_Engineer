Assumptions:
1. The system will be implemented in Python.
2. The system will be a simple command-line application.
3. The system will manage patients and doctors.
4. The system will allow adding and listing patients and doctors.
5. The system will not use a real database; data will be stored in memory.
6. The system will be modular, with separate classes for patients and doctors.
7. The system will include a main application class to handle user input and manage the hospital system.

Core classes, functions, and methods:
- `Patient`: Represents a patient with attributes like ID, name, and age.
- `Doctor`: Represents a doctor with attributes like ID, name, and specialization.
- `HospitalManagementSystem`: Manages the operations of the hospital system, such as adding/listing patients and doctors.
- `main`: The entry point of the application that provides a user interface for interacting with the hospital management system.

Let's start with the entry point file:

main.py
```python
from hospital_management_system import HospitalManagementSystem

def main():
    system = HospitalManagementSystem()
    while True:
        print("\nHospital Management System")
        print("1. Add new patient")
        print("2. List all patients")
        print("3. Add new doctor")
        print("4. List all doctors")
        print("5. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == '1':
            patient_id = input("Enter patient ID: ")
            name = input("Enter patient name: ")
            age = input("Enter patient age: ")
            system.add_patient(patient_id, name, age)
        elif choice == '2':
            system.list_patients()
        elif choice == '3':
            doctor_id = input("Enter doctor ID: ")
            name = input("Enter doctor name: ")
            specialization = input("Enter doctor specialization: ")
            system.add_doctor(doctor_id, name, specialization)
        elif choice == '4':
            system.list_doctors()
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Exiting the system.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's define the `HospitalManagementSystem` class and its dependencies:

hospital_management_system.py
```python
from patient import Patient
from doctor import Doctor

class HospitalManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patients = []
        self.doctors = []

    def add_patient(self, patient_id, name, age):
        new_patient = Patient(patient_id, name, age)
        self.patients.append(new_patient)
        print(f"Patient {name} added successfully.")

    def list_patients(self):
        for patient in self.patients:
            print(f"ID: {patient.patient_id}, Name: {patient.name}, Age: {patient.age}")

    def add_doctor(self, doctor_id, name, specialization):
        new_doctor = Doctor(doctor_id, name, specialization)
        self.doctors.append(new_doctor)
        print(f"Doctor {name} added successfully.")

    def list_doctors(self):
        for doctor in self.doctors:
            print(f"ID: {doctor.doctor_id}, Name: {doctor.name}, Specialization: {doctor.specialization}")
```

Next, we define the `Patient` class:

patient.py
```python
class Patient:
    def __init__(self, patient_id, name, age):
        self.patient_id = patient_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

And the `Doctor` class:

doctor.py
```python
class Doctor:
    def __init__(self, doctor_id, name, specialization):
        self.doctor_id = doctor_id
        self.name = name
        self.specialization = specialization
```

Lastly, we need a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies for the project. Since this is a simple Python application without external libraries, the `requirements.txt` will be empty, but it's good practice to include it:

requirements.txt
```
# No external dependencies required
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
