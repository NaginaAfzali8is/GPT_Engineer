To make the design of the popup more attractive, we would typically need to update the `popup.html` file to include better styling and possibly some additional HTML elements to improve the layout. We might also want to update the `popup.js` file if we're adding interactive elements that require JavaScript. Additionally, we could add a new `styles.css` file to include all the CSS rules that will make the popup look more attractive.

Here's a step-by-step plan for the changes:

1. Update `popup.html` to include a link to the new `styles.css` file.
2. Add more semantic HTML elements to `popup.html` for better structure, such as headers, sections, and footers.
3. Create a new `styles.css` file with attractive styling rules. This will include setting a color scheme, fonts, padding, margins, and possibly animations or transitions for interactive elements.
4. If necessary, update `popup.js` to handle any new interactive elements that we've added to the popup, such as buttons or form elements.

Now, let's write the changes in the unified "git diff" syntax.
