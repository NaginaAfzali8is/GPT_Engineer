To implement a train ticket fare calculation system in Python, we will need several classes and functions to handle different aspects of the fare calculation. Here's an outline of the core components:

- `Ticket`: A class representing a train ticket.
- `FareCalculator`: A class responsible for calculating the fare based on various factors.
- `DiscountPolicy`: A class or a set of classes representing different discount policies.
- `Train`: A class representing a train, which may affect the fare calculation.
- `Journey`: A class representing a journey, which includes the origin, destination, and distance.
- `Passenger`: A class representing a passenger, which may include age or other factors affecting the fare.

Let's start by creating the entry point file which will use these classes to calculate the fare for a given ticket.

entrypoint.py
```python
from fare_calculator import FareCalculator
from journey import Journey
from passenger import Passenger
from ticket import Ticket

def main():
    # Example usage
    journey = Journey(origin="New York", destination="Washington D.C.", distance=225)
    passenger = Passenger(age=25)
    ticket = Ticket(journey=journey, passenger=passenger)

    calculator = FareCalculator()
    fare = calculator.calculate_fare(ticket)
    print(f"The fare for your journey is: ${fare:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now let's define the `Journey` class.

journey.py
```python
class Journey:
    def __init__(self, origin, destination, distance):
        self.origin = origin
        self.destination = destination
        self.distance = distance
```

Next, we define the `Passenger` class.

passenger.py
```python
class Passenger:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age
```

Now, let's define the `Ticket` class.

ticket.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from journey import Journey
from passenger import Passenger

@dataclass
class Ticket:
    journey: Journey
    passenger: Passenger
```

Next, we define the `FareCalculator` class.

fare_calculator.py
```python
from ticket import Ticket
from discount_policy import BaseDiscountPolicy

class FareCalculator:
    BASE_FARE_PER_MILE = 0.5  # Example base fare

    def __init__(self, discount_policy=None):
        if discount_policy is None:
            discount_policy = BaseDiscountPolicy()
        self.discount_policy = discount_policy

    def calculate_fare(self, ticket: Ticket):
        base_fare = ticket.journey.distance * self.BASE_FARE_PER_MILE
        discount = self.discount_policy.apply_discount(ticket, base_fare)
        return max(base_fare - discount, 0)  # Fare should not be negative
```

Now, let's define the `DiscountPolicy` class and a base policy.

discount_policy.py
```python
from ticket import Ticket

class BaseDiscountPolicy:
    def apply_discount(self, ticket: Ticket, base_fare: float) -> float:
        # Example base discount policy, no discount
        return 0.0
```

Finally, we need to create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies.

requirements.txt
```
# No external dependencies are required for this basic implementation
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
