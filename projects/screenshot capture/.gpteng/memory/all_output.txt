To implement a screenshot capture tool in Python that takes a screenshot every 2 minutes, we will use the `Pillow` library for capturing the screen and the `schedule` library for scheduling the task. We will also use the `time` module to handle the sleep functionality.

Here's the plan for the implementation:

1. `main.py`: The entry point of the application that sets up the scheduler and starts the loop.
2. `screenshot.py`: Contains the `ScreenshotTaker` class responsible for capturing and saving screenshots.
3. `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the project.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:

main.py
```python
import time
import schedule
from screenshot import ScreenshotTaker

def job():
    """Function to capture and save a screenshot."""
    screenshot_taker = ScreenshotTaker()
    screenshot_taker.capture_and_save()

def main():
    """Main function to schedule the screenshot capture every 2 minutes."""
    schedule.every(2).minutes.do(job)

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's create the `screenshot.py` file:

screenshot.py
```python
from PIL import ImageGrab
import datetime
import os

class ScreenshotTaker:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the screenshot taker with a directory for saving screenshots."""
        self.screenshots_dir = "screenshots"
        if not os.path.exists(self.screenshots_dir):
            os.makedirs(self.screenshots_dir)

    def capture_and_save(self):
        """Capture the screen and save it to a file."""
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
        screenshot = ImageGrab.grab()
        filename = f"{self.screenshots_dir}/screenshot_{timestamp}.png"
        screenshot.save(filename)
        print(f"Screenshot saved as {filename}")

```

Lastly, we need to create the `requirements.txt` file to list the dependencies:

requirements.txt
```
Pillow
schedule
```

To run this application, you would need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the `main.py` script to start taking screenshots every 2 minutes:

```sh
python main.py
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
